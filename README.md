# Myhammer coding challenge

Built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20 
          and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) version 4.4.1
          and  🖤 and 🤩 and 🤯 by Markus Heine

## Task

> Create a responsive two-panel overview page in Angular. The attached jobs Json-File should be loaded with an HTTP-Request. Inside of the first panel, render a list of all the “active” jobs.
>  Once the user clicks on a job item from the list, show detailed information of the selected job on the second panel.
>
> Feel free to decide which information needs to be displayed in job item and which in job detail view. Using libraries like Bootstrap 4 or Angular Material is a plus.
>  Tests with Karma and/or Protractor is a plus.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
